# Paper Track (Short Workshop Target)

## Candidate paper angle

**Title direction**: *Practical Throughput-Quality Optimization for Mosaic Video Restoration in Real Deployment Pipelines*

## Main contributions

- Adaptive batch policy based on real VRAM budget
- Product-grade queue and credit-aware scheduling constraints
- End-to-end benchmark protocol for restoration deployment

## Minimal publishable package

- Reproducible benchmark scripts
- Clear baseline and ablation tables
- One deployment case study (Telegram operation scenario)

## Risk control

- Keep legal/compliance section explicit.
- Keep dataset provenance and filtering rules documented.
- Avoid claims beyond empirical results on declared test sets.
